**Profile Summary:**

My life has been an incredible journey.  It's been full of love, laughter, learning, and even some struggles that shaped me into who I am.  I was fortunate to have a warm, adventurous childhood filled with memories of summer days at my grandparents' farm, catching fireflies, and the comforting aroma of my grandmother's apple pies. Family vacations to the coast were magical, building sandcastles and listening to the waves. My parents, a hardworking and principled construction worker and a compassionate teacher, instilled in me a strong work ethic, a love of learning, and the importance of empathy.  

My spouse has been the greatest love of my life. We met during a volunteer project, and our love blossomed from a friendship. We've grown together, supporting each other through thick and thin.  Raising kind and thoughtful children has been my greatest achievement. I'm also proud of the community center I helped establish, a place that has brought education and support to so many.  While my first business venture failed, it taught me valuable lessons about resilience and adaptability. My career allowed me to mentor young professionals and engage in creative problem-solving, but I learned the importance of work-life balance and being present with loved ones.

I believe in kindness, compassion, and the interconnectedness of all things. My spirituality has evolved from traditional roots to a more personal and inclusive understanding of faith.  Gardening, photography, cooking, music, and hiking brought me immense joy.  I collected vintage maps, each telling a story of the past, and I enjoyed bird watching, finding peace in nature's quiet moments.  Facing a serious illness in my forties was my most challenging period, but it taught me to appreciate life's precious moments and live with intention. I overcame obstacles by focusing on what I could control, relying on supportive relationships, and viewing challenges as opportunities for growth.

I hope to be remembered as someone who loved generously and lived authentically, finding joy in small things and maintaining hope. I hope my legacy is one of kindness, compassion, and connection.  I'm deeply grateful for the love in my life, my family, my friends, good health, and the opportunity to learn and grow.  While I have some regrets about missed moments and unfulfilled possibilities, I've found peace in knowing they've shaped me into who I am.
