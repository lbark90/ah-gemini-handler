**Profile Summary:**

Life, for me, has been a journey of finding joy in the simplest things â€“ a warm cup of coffee on a rainy morning, the laughter of loved ones, the quiet beauty of nature. I've always been drawn to exploring the world, both the vast landscapes and the inner worlds of the heart and mind.  My childhood in Portland was filled with adventures in the forests and mountains, building forts and dreaming big dreams with my brothers. Those camping trips to Crater Lake with my family hold a special place in my heart.  As I grew older, my passion for learning led me to a career in technology, where I found immense satisfaction in creating educational software that helped children learn and grow.  Sharing my knowledge and mentoring young women in the field was equally rewarding.  Through it all, the thread that connects every experience is the love I shared with family and friends.  Those connections, those moments of laughter and shared joy, are the treasures I cherish most.
